# Documentation contributor guide

This directory contains the Sphinx documentation for **Schafkopf RL**. Tox is the preferred interface because it uses the same isolated documentation environment locally and in CI. Direct commands are included for focused debugging and for understanding what Tox invokes.

## Quick reference

| Task | Preferred Tox command | Direct command |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Build HTML and validate API coverage | `uv run --locked tox run -e docs` | `uv run --locked --group docs python scripts/build_docs.py all` |
| Build HTML only | `uv run --locked tox run -e docs -- html` | `uv run --locked --group docs python scripts/build_docs.py html` |
| Validate API documentation coverage | `uv run --locked tox run -e docs -- coverage` | `uv run --locked --group docs python scripts/build_docs.py coverage` |
| Remove generated documentation files | `uv run --locked tox run -e docs -- clean` | `uv run --locked --group docs python scripts/build_docs.py clean` |
| Generate UML sources only | `uv run --locked tox run -e uml` | `uv run --locked --group docs python scripts/generate_uml.py` |

The default `docs` target is the CI-quality check. It installs the project wheel, runs API documentation coverage, builds the HTML site, treats Sphinx warnings as failures, and writes builder-specific doctrees and output under `reports/sphinx/`.

## Documentation layout

| Path | Ownership | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `docs/README.md` | Authored | This contributor guide. It is repository-facing by default and can be included in the Sphinx site through a source wrapper page. |
| `docs/source/index.md` | Authored | Root page and main Sphinx `toctree`. Add top-level pages here. |
| `docs/source/readme.md` | Authored | Includes the root project `README.md` so the project overview and usage have one source of truth. |
| `docs/source/command-reference.md` | Template-rendered | Project-specific command contract containing only the tasks enabled by the selected Copier options. |
| `docs/source/api.rst` | Authored | Root Autosummary declaration for the `schafkopfrl` package. |
| `docs/source/conf.py` | Authored | Sphinx extensions, theme, coverage policy, notebook policy, and optional feature configuration. |
| `docs/source/_templates/autosummary/` | Authored | Templates controlling generated module and class API pages. |
| `docs/source/_autosummary/` | Generated | Autosummary API pages. Do not edit or commit them. |
| `docs/source/notebooks/` | Authored | Notebooks published as documentation and their index page. |
| `notebooks/` | Authored | Exploratory notebooks. These are validated and stripped, but are not automatically published. |
| `docs/source/diagrams/index.rst` | Authored | Sphinx page embedding generated Mermaid diagrams. |
| `docs/source/diagrams/*.mmd` | Generated | Mermaid sources produced from the installed package by Pyreverse. Do not edit or commit them. |
| `reports/sphinx/html/` | Generated | Rendered HTML documentation. |
| `reports/sphinx/coverage/` | Generated | Raw and browser-readable API documentation coverage reports. |

Generated source-side artefacts and rendered output are ignored by Git and removed by the documentation clean target.

## How the build works

`tox.ini` calls:

```ini
python scripts/build_docs.py {posargs:all}
```

The policy script performs the following work:

1. Selects `all`, `html`, `coverage`, or `clean` from the Tox positional argument.
2. Generates Mermaid UML sources before Sphinx runs.
3. Runs each selected Sphinx builder with a separate doctree directory.
4. Sets `PROJECT_DOCS_BUILDER` so `conf.py` can omit notebooks, diagrams, and gallery execution from the API coverage build.
5. Treats Sphinx warnings as build failures while continuing far enough to report multiple documentation problems.
6. Converts the Sphinx Python coverage report into `reports/sphinx/coverage/index.html` and fails when public functions or classes are undocumented or modules fail to import.
7. On `clean`, removes rendered output and generated Autosummary, gallery, and Mermaid files.

The `Makefile` and `make.bat` wrappers call the same script. They are convenience entry points; Tox remains the normal developer and CI interface.

## Add a Markdown page

Human-authored narrative pages should normally use MyST Markdown. Create a file under `docs/source/`, for example `docs/source/methodology.md`:

````markdown
(methodology)=
# Methodology

Describe the design, experiment, data pipeline, or operational procedure here.

```{note}
MyST directives provide Sphinx features inside Markdown.
```

See the {doc}`API reference <api>` for implementation details.
````

Add the page stem, without `.md`, to the `toctree` in `docs/source/index.md`:

````markdown
```{toctree}
:maxdepth: 2
:caption: Contents

readme
methodology
api
```
````

Then build the HTML site:

```bash
uv run --locked tox run -e docs -- html
```

The fully enabled data-science example follows this pattern with `docs/source/data-science-example.md` and adds `data-science-example` to the root `toctree`.

## Publish this contributor guide

The full data-science example publishes this repository guide without duplicating it. Its `docs/source/documentation-guide.md` wrapper contains:

````markdown
```{include} ../README.md
```
````

The wrapper is added to the root `toctree` as `documentation-guide`. This keeps `docs/README.md` as the single authored source while making the same material available in the generated HTML site. Other projects can adopt the same pattern when contributor documentation should be public.

## Add a reStructuredText page

Sphinx supports MyST Markdown and reStructuredText in the same source tree. ReStructuredText remains useful for extension-oriented index pages. For example:

```rst
Operations
==========

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   deployment
   monitoring
```

Add the page stem to an existing `toctree` in the same way as a Markdown page. Prefer MyST Markdown for prose unless a Sphinx extension is clearer in reStructuredText.

## Document the Python API

The root API page recursively documents the installed package:

```rst
.. autosummary::
   :toctree: _autosummary
   :recursive:

   schafkopfrl
```

To add API documentation:

1. Add or update public modules, functions, classes, and methods under `src/schafkopfrl/`.
2. Give public objects complete **Google-style** docstrings.
3. Run static validation so the docstrings are formatted and linted:

   ```bash
   uv run --locked tox run -e lint
   ```

4. Run the API coverage target:

   ```bash
   uv run --locked tox run -e docs -- coverage
   ```

5. Inspect `reports/sphinx/coverage/index.html` or the raw `reports/sphinx/coverage/python.txt` when the target fails.

Autosummary writes generated pages under `docs/source/_autosummary/`. Change `docs/source/_templates/autosummary/module.rst` or `class.rst` when the generated API layout needs to change; do not edit generated pages directly.

The documentation build imports the installed package. Keep import-time code lightweight and protect executable entry points with:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Add a documentation notebook

There are two notebook locations with different policies:

- `notebooks/` contains exploratory notebooks. The notebook Tox environment checks that their removable outputs and volatile metadata have been stripped.
- `docs/source/notebooks/` contains notebooks intended for publication. They are parsed by MyST-NB and are not automatically stripped.

To publish a notebook:

1. Create or copy the notebook into `docs/source/notebooks/`, for example `docs/source/notebooks/model-evaluation.ipynb`.
2. Ensure its kernel metadata refers to an available Python kernel.
3. Add its stem to `docs/source/notebooks/index.rst`:

   ```rst
   Notebook gallery
   ================

   .. toctree::
      :maxdepth: 1

      example
      model-evaluation
   ```

4. Run notebook validation:

   ```bash
   uv run --locked tox run -e notebooks
   ```

5. Build the documentation:

   ```bash
   uv run --locked tox run -e docs -- html
   ```

The template sets `nb_execution_mode = "off"`. Sphinx does not execute documentation notebooks during the build; it renders the source and any outputs already stored in the notebook. Execute and review a documentation notebook before committing when published outputs are required. Keep exploratory outputs out of `notebooks/` unless a cell is explicitly marked to retain them according to the project README.

## Update UML diagrams

The documentation build generates package and class diagrams from the installed `schafkopfrl` package:

```bash
uv run --locked tox run -e uml
```

The complete documentation target also runs UML generation automatically. `scripts/generate_uml.py` invokes Pyreverse and writes Mermaid sources under `docs/source/diagrams/`; `docs/source/diagrams/index.rst` embeds those files through `sphinxcontrib-mermaid`.

Do not edit generated `.mmd` files. Change the Python package structure or `scripts/generate_uml.py`, then regenerate them. Edit `docs/source/diagrams/index.rst` only when changing captions, ordering, or surrounding explanatory text.

## Update the root README page

`docs/source/readme.md` includes the repository root `README.md`:

````markdown
```{include} ../../README.md
:start-after: "# Schafkopf RL"
:relative-docs: docs/
:relative-images:
```
````

Edit the root `README.md` for the public project overview, installation, usage, and project links. Put daily repository work in `CONTRIBUTING.md`, maintainer-only operations in `MAINTAINING.md`, and documentation authoring in this guide. The included documentation page updates on the next Sphinx build.

## Generated output and cleanup

A successful complete build writes:

- `reports/sphinx/html/index.html`: published HTML entry point.
- `reports/sphinx/coverage/index.html`: browser-readable API documentation coverage.
- `reports/sphinx/coverage/python.txt`: raw API coverage report.
- `reports/sphinx/.doctrees/`: isolated Sphinx state for each builder.

Remove all documentation build output and source-side generated artefacts with:

```bash
uv run --locked tox run -e docs -- clean
```

Use the project-wide clean environment when also removing test reports and distribution artefacts:

```bash
uv run --locked tox run -e clean
```

## Troubleshooting

### A warning fails the build

This is intentional. The build uses `--fail-on-warning`, so broken references, malformed directives, missing documents, duplicate labels, and similar warnings are CI failures. Read the first warning in the Sphinx output, correct the source, and rerun the same target.

### A module fails to import

Sphinx documents the installed wheel, not an ad-hoc `src/` path. Confirm that the package builds and imports in the documentation environment, avoid undeclared optional imports at module import time, and run:

```bash
uv run --locked tox run -e package-check
uv run --locked tox run -e docs -- coverage
```

### API coverage is incomplete

Open `reports/sphinx/coverage/index.html`. Add docstrings to the listed public objects, expose the intended object through the package structure, or explicitly adjust the coverage policy in `docs/source/conf.py` when an object is intentionally excluded.

### A notebook page has stale or missing output

The documentation build does not execute notebooks. Open the notebook with JupyterLab, execute it deliberately, review the stored output, save it under `docs/source/notebooks/`, and rebuild:

```bash
uv run --group notebooks jupyter lab
uv run --locked tox run -e docs -- html
```
